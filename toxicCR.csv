 For proposal #2, note that I mentioned the deserialize call would return an instance of the class. This might not the most ideal thing to do for this method, though.
 
 For proposal #1, I don't think there's actually a problem. You can create an ""empy"" object with a ""dummy"" name and then have the deserialize method overwrite it.
 
  >>> class A(object):
  ... def __init__(self, name):
  ... self.name = name
  ... def deserialize(self, o):
  ... self.__dict__ = o
  ... 
  >>> obj = A('test')
  >>> obj.deserialize({'name': 'new_name'})
  >>> obj.name
  'new_name'
  >>>

 https://github.com/openstack/manila/blob/master/manila/share/manager.py#L1700
 
 If you always throw ShareResourceNotFound (no if/else condition as in your code), manager will do exactly what you are doing, it will swallow the exception and proceed. If it is not ""Deleting path"", as you are checking for such in share status, it will throw exception, just as are you doing, since manager is only swallowing the exception when deleting the share.
 
 The only scenario which I think this is valid is if this library is used outside of Manila, which is what I understood based on our IRC conversation, but by using share['status'] here I am assuming it will not be used outside of Manila Manager code path.

    - Console apps seem to not do what you expect here -- the default behaviour will kill the console window without affecting the ""main"" process of the app
    - If you wanted to act on a failed attempt with a heavy handed TerminateProcess, you need to block even longer or delay stuff on the event loop. We don't want to do either here.

 1) Is it possible to UNPAUSE a machine which is RUNNING!? (I would think that you can only UNPAUSE something that is PAUSED, hidden bug? Why UNPAUSING is being saved to the db if the current state is RUNNING?)
 
 2) I think that for [UN]PAUSING we should take a different approach than this.
 
 At this point, the real state of the instance is unknown right? We don't know whether the instance was paused or not, but, we already know the desired state and the current state why we just don't automate that?
 
 If before n-cpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and I assume that the API have returned saying that the requested was accept, why we don't re-issue the [un]pause_instance() request here?
 
 I mean users would be like: ""fuck yeah automation""!
 
 Instead of just cleaning up the states, leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reissue the request to [un]pause the machine again.

 At this point, the real state of the instance is unknown right? We don't know whether the instance was paused or not, but, we already know the desired state and the current state why we just don't automate that?
 
 If before n-cpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and I assume that the API have returned saying that the requested was accept, why we don't re-issue the [un]pause_instance() request here?
 
 I mean users would be like: ""fuck yeah automation""!
 
 Instead of just cleaning up the states, leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reissue the request to [un]pause the machine again.

 It sounds like you've created a new channel for the decoder to inform the demuxer of a config change. If so, one thing to be aware of (assuming you're still using our decoder stream) is that signalling kConfigChanged from the demuxer will result in a flush of the decoder. Many config changes actually require a different decoder, so this makes sense. But in your case, this is probably wasteful. For videos that change size mid way through, we just signal the new size to the upper layers and avoid the heavy decoder flush.

 I guess the difference between a 'graceful shutdown' and using the middleware is that one is event driven where the other one requires you to pick a 'long time' and assume that after that there are no requests being handled.
 
 Which would work ... but the code to implement the graceful shutdown could be pretty easy (potentially just a few lines of code), so might be worth thinking about.
 
 It's probably just a matter of changing these functions in wsgi.py:
 
 
  def wait_on_children(self):
  while self.running:
  try:
  pid, status = os.wait()
  if os.WIFEXITED(status) or os.WIFSIGNALED(status):
  self._remove_children(pid)
  self._verify_and_respawn_children(pid, status)
  except OSError as err:
  if err.errno not in (errno.EINTR, errno.ECHILD):
  raise
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
  LOG.info(_LI('Caught keyboard interrupt. Exiting.'))
  break
  except exception.SIGHUPInterrupt:
  self.reload()
  continue
  eventlet.greenio.shutdown_safe(self.sock)
  self.sock.close()
  LOG.debug('Exited')
 
 
  def run_child(self):
  def child_hup(*args):
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled.""""""
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal.SIG_IGN)
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False
  self.sock.close()
 
  pid = os.fork()
  if pid == 0:
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, child_hup)
  signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
 
 to look like this:
 
  def wait_on_children(self):
  while self.running:
  try:
  pid, status = os.wait()
  if os.WIFEXITED(status) or os.WIFSIGNALED(status):
  self._remove_children(pid)
  self._verify_and_respawn_children(pid, status)
  except OSError as err:
  if err.errno not in (errno.EINTR, errno.ECHILD):
  raise
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
  LOG.info(_LI('Caught keyboard interrupt. Exiting.'))
  break
  except exception.SIGHUPInterrupt:
  self.reload()
  continue
  except exception.SIGSTOPInterrupt: <<<
  self.graceful_shutdown() <<<
  continue <<<
  eventlet.greenio.shutdown_safe(self.sock)
  self.sock.close()
  LOG.debug('Exited')
 
 
  def run_child(self):
  def child_hup(*args):
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled.""""""
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal.SIG_IGN)
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False
  self.sock.close()
 
  def child_stop(*args): <<<
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled."""""" <<<
  signal.signal(signal.SIGSTOP, signal.SIG_IGN) <<< 
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False <<< 
  self.sock.close() <<<
 
  pid = os.fork()
  if pid == 0:
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, child_hup)
  signal.signal(signal.SIGSTOP, child_stop) <<<
  signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
 
 
 And add this one line function:
 
  def graceful_shutdown(self):
  """"""
  Send signal to child processes to handle current requests then exit
  """"""
  os.killpg(self.pgid, signal.SIGSTOP)
 
 
 I haven't tested the above, I think it might be sufficient because the existing code will do the accounting of the number of children and exit when self.children hits zero, but it'd need testing.
 
 You'd do ""kill -s STOP <glance-parent-process-pid>""",0

 * deployer has template that needs capabilities (provided by other templates)

 * deployer selects provider templates and writes corresponding env file

 - every time the AP boots, we should have the same default sensor settings.
 - if the AP goes to suspend (S3) and wakes back up (S0) the settings shall not have changed.
 - in S3, and in S5, only sample specific sensors that are needed.

"This seems rather dangerous to me actually. If we start expecting that the display_name that we give to the instance is in DNS, and we don't fail the operation if we can't satisfy that, then users have the potential to do insecure things without realizing. For example:

  ssh -u myuser foo.provider.com
  ### Accept host key?
  y
  ssh password for myuser@foo.provider.com: *****
  Permission denied
  ssh password for myuser@foo.provider.com: *****
 
 and thus I've just given my password to someone who guessed the hostname that I wanted. Unless we expose the actual hostname back to the nova user somehow, we can't really blame someone for committing the above offense, IMHO, which is pretty bad.",0

 * self._vmutils.detach_vm_disk will silently do nothing [1]
 * New disk with invalid path with be added [2]
 
 This definitely won't work as the user intends. As it's unsupported at the moment that's fine, but it would be much nicer to the user to tell them that with a clear error message rather than leaving them wondering why their rescued instance doesn't work.
 
 Also, I haven't looked at the interaction with unrescue, but it's critical that the above mess can be unwound with unrescue. If it currently work it's presumably just luck :)
 
 TL;DR
 
 Not supporting everything is fine, but I think you need to explicitly check that root_vhd_path exists and there is only 1 disk. If not, you need to error out early.

"Well the logic of claiming/consuming instances is not what caused this bug (and it is well tested). What caused it is moving to and from objects in the resource tracker, and then dropping an important field due to that.
 
 So in the resource tracker we have pci pool dicts (would contain numa_node as a key), but then we convert them to objects [1] by using PciDevicePool.from_dict, which would drop the field and save it as part of tags.
 
 Upon reading them in on the scheduler side, we call PciDevicePool.to_dict, which of course will not know about the 'numa_node' since it's not on the object. For filtering to work numa_node needs to match (and it's actually gone) so all requests fail.
 
 The code in [1] merged 2 months after the patch that introduces NUMA awareness of PCI devices.
 
 TL; DR - this got borken by our neverending objects fuckery - it was not broken by definition as you seem to imply with your comments here.

"I definitely agree we shouldn't mix the two. I think the list syntax makes more sense in this case than it does in capabilities (I previously made comments to this end on that spec, but they got lost in a previous patchset, so I'll review it again soon).
 
 Take a simple resource registry:
 
 resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::BlockStorage: cinder-storage.yaml
  OS::TripleO::Compute: compute.yaml
 
 What that is saying is that when a template creates a resource of type BlockStorage, it should use the cinder-storage.yaml file.
 
 Taking the example from the capabilities:
 
 requires:
  deployment: puppet
 
 resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::Controller: [puppet/controller.yaml, docker/controller.yaml]
 
 You (as the template reader/maintainer, not as Heat programmatically reading it) are no longer able to see what template will be used. That information has moved to the ""requires"" area plus some additional logic that looks inside the templates themselves.
 
 Now factor in the alternative in this spec for using a parameter driven approach.
 That's now a third place you need to look to understand which template(s) will be used to fulfill a given type, leaving us with the following to understand a set of templates:
 
 1. Look in the resource registry to see the mapping for a type.
 2. If the mapping is a list, look at the requires and the contents of each template referenced to see which one will fulfill the requires.
 3. Look through the top level template itself for any ResourceChain resources, determine the name of the parameter that's used to convey the list of templates in the chain, then resolve what the current value of that parameter is.
 
 IMO, this is a rough experience for the user. We've taken the knowledge of how a stack will be created and spread it over the course of multiple areas and files.
 
 By comparison, my argument is that:
 
 - Capabilities aren't a black box resolution by Heat, but rather just metadata the user can ask Heat to introspect to determine valid mappings to make in the resource_registry. 
 - Chains are communicated inside of the registry itself.
 
 That flow leaves the mappings in a single place: the resource registry. It's simpler both for user comprehension and clients that may be layering on top of the templates.",0

"> javascript: stupidest thing ever?

So interesting :D It seems you are asking if this can be treated as plain text. But I don't think GURL is smart enough to understand javascript syntax. Telling ""javacript: stupidest thing ever?"" from ""javascript: var a = 0; alert(a); "" would be really difficult. So is_valid() returns true for both I guess. (roughly tested but ""javascript: stu..."" wasn't droppable with is_valid())

> we shouldn't even try to check the Javascript scheme here,

This reminds me of our previous conversation. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1013821/7/chrome/browser/ui/views/frame/browser_root_view.cc#180
Like !file_supported case, I think arrow on tabstrip and cursor icon should indicate that javascript scheme can't be dropped during drag session. So I think it's better to check the scheme here as long as we can.

correct -- it /could/ have been if base::Process::Open* fails. on the other hand, if base::Process::Open* succeeds but finds a proc with a different parent (due to pid reuse), we know that we should ignore this process.

> However, its child processes may not be killed yet, so we need to add its pid to the flat_map and continue hunting for the descendant processes. 

ah, i see. that's a good point. but if the pid was reused, we don't want to kill the new proc's kids! to be totally paranoid, OpenProcessIfChildOf would need to report to callers whether the pid was definitively reused or not. i think what you have now is good enough for test code. maybe drop a comment explaining the possibilities since it's a bit subtle.

> Either version works fine for this specific case as killing the direct child process automatically kills all the descendant processes (gpu, utility, etc) per my local tests.

yes, chrome puts its sub-procs in a job object so that they all should die with the parent. at least, i think that's how it works. you can probably test this trivially by killing a browser proc with plenty of subprocs. i think they evaporate straight away.",0

If we need further discussion over all openstack client, I think it is beyond of this patch.

"Chris: I'm sort of of the mind that having only two tests here to begin with speaks to insufficient coverage of the capability and paints us into a corner with respect to procedure (e.g. what if Tempest just flat out had a bug that broke these two tests?). This is something we should bring up with the Committee. In the interim I'd like to look and see if there aren't other tests that could be added for the capability, but unfortunately they'd have to go through the advisory cycle first and won't really help for 2015.05(ish). I'll also note that there's a *potential* loophole should we feel the need to invoke it: the bylaw states that *vendors* may not request flagging all tests for a capability (refer to https://github.com/openstack/defcore/blob/master/process/2015A.rst#community-review--vendor-self-test-c C(3)4 for the actual wording). So if, for example, the Foundation (through it's Interoperability Engineer, presumably) or perhaps folks acting on behalf of the Board (like, say, the co-chairs of the DefCore Committee, though I'll note one of them has a potential conflict of interest in this particular instance as she is employed by the same vendor) were to request it, that wouldn't violate the bylaw.
 
 In the interim: you're right. We can't accept dropping all the tests for a capability at a vendor's request, so I'm -1. Still, I'm going to look into whether there are additional tests we should be including so that they can start the advisory phase sooner rather than later.",0

"Yes, I found the issue when the passwd entry was legitimately missing. I was surprised to see both arc-networkd processes running as root in `ps`.
 
 Under normal circumstances the entry shouldn't be missing, and the risk of something affecting *this* daemon is low. But security-critical code often gets attacked in ways that cause something that ""shouldn't"" fail to fail, e.g.
 
 - Maybe the bad guy can't write arbitrary contents into /etc/passwd, but (on a normal Linux box) he might be able to trick a careless cron job into erasing/clobbering its contents through symlink attacks. And then subsequent calls to getpwnam() fail.
 
 - Since Chrome OS uses dm-verity to protect the rootfs contents, somebody can't get the OS to return arbitrary data when reading a file. But maybe they can get the OS to return an I/O error if the file data is overwritten with bad content on disk.
 
 - Exhaustion attacks can sometimes induce failures that are useful to a hacker, e.g.
 
 https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/255-android-rooting
 
 What if somebody opens up 1023 file descriptors, then runs a setuid program that fails to open the 1024th FD and reacts in a careless way?

 We need to find a way where the main resource and the sub resource can be created/updated/returned in the same API request. However, if necessary, the user should be able to operate directly on the subresource.
 
 This is probably something that can't be addressed for this release cycle. So if there is any urgency around this blueprint we might proceed this way and then rework it in Kilo.

"> > This previously used a TestNavigationObserver, but this no longer works for the filesystem URL following Mustafa's r554850, because a top-level filesystem URL navigation will be blocked on the renderer side.  I wanted to keep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem URLs, so I tried to use WaitForLoadStop(), which just exits immediately if a navigation hasn't started yet.  However, with blob: URLs, that still didn't work, because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side, so the ExecuteScript that sets location above returns before we've received the BeginNavigation from the renderer.  Hence this ugly extra dummy ExecuteScript.  Without it, we performed the checks below too early, and when GetTextContent() below did a roundtrip to the renderer, we actually received the BeginNavigation and created a speculative RFH, which caused GetRenderFrameHostsForExtension to fail.

No, unfortunately blobs don't output the console error.  Given that, I'll stick with this approach.

"does Brillo support platform development on Windows? Android doesn't.

otherwise, i'm starting to think this is a mistake. we're doing command execution, but only in a very limited form. we're doing environment variable substitution, but badly. it feels like the best we can hope for is to achieve parity with the shell --- but we already have perfectly good shells.

your example provisioning script looks identical as a shell script except that each line starts with ""fastboot "".

the ""too much room for hacks"" is probably a good thing --- sooner or later there's going to be some custom bullshit an OEM needs you to do, and then you either hack that in to fastboot or have a separate shell script you need to run in addition to ""fastboot provision"". this is why Android's init is such an awful mess. they wanted it to be ""minimal"" but bad things happen when you collide with reality. especially in areas where OEMs are involved. the recovery image links in an arbitrary OEM-provided .so to solve the equivalent problem there. yeah, the shell's not lovely, but the alternatives all tend to be worse...

 For proposal #2, note that I mentioned the deserialize call would return an instance of the class. This might not the most ideal thing to do for this method, though.
 
 For proposal #1, I don't think there's actually a problem. You can create an ""empy"" object with a ""dummy"" name and then have the deserialize method overwrite it.
 
  >>> class A(object):
  ... def __init__(self, name):
  ... self.name = name
  ... def deserialize(self, o):
  ... self.__dict__ = o
  ... 
  >>> obj = A('test')
  >>> obj.deserialize({'name': 'new_name'})
  >>> obj.name
  'new_name'
  >>> 
 
 
 I understand the point behind passing the flag is to validate that either of those are set but I personally don't see a huge value in that for this specific case. One reason I prefer #2 is because it'd avoid creating an instance of the object with dummy/None data.",0

On the other hand a user may forget to supply or decide not to supply volume_id and in this case all hosts should pass. In this case I set filtering_result to True and use it as return value. If on the yet another hand it is set to None that means that we have a valid volume_id and are in process of filtering.

Don't assign to the attribute intermediate values.  You mangle the hell out of boto_file throughout the following values- assign once the value has stabilized.

The reasons for this style don't strictly apply here, but the style should be used regardless since it's good form; basically, if ever dealing w/ cpy initializers, threading, etc, take your pick, having intermediate assignment like this means you've got varying state that can bite you in the ass.

Worse, if the init method goes and invokes methods to finish initialization, if an intermediate value is stashed on the instance, the method can use that value w/out you getting an AttributeError; etc, thus assign once stable.

Upshot, the form I mentioned is safer, and it's also marginally faster (the latter is true, but so small it's more a joke than a valid reason exempting extreme cases ;) )",1

 note this doesn't need any of these +0.5 hacks.
 
 But! This isn't taking into account scale factor -- it will draw a focus borer of 1 DIP, not 1 pixel. That might be incorrect.

 We might need to worry about sqrt, but I'd need to profile. I'll try comparing performance to versions that stub out sqrt.
 
 It's not much of an issue on my desktop, where the *total* cost to record the 3 latency derived metrics is ~3us. It's >10us on my Pixel 1 though. That includes re-calculating a sqrt from N frames ago to subtract from the WindowedAnalyzer's accumulator. So there's 6 sqrts total per source frame (3 metrics * 2 sqrts).
 
 All the sqrts currently use double precision, but I'm pretty sure single precision would be good enough. In general, after getting the basics in place, I'd like to switch the double precision math over to single precision where we can.
 
 If we really need to, we could use a sqrt approximation. As long as the approximation is monotonic, it should be good at tracking relative performance deltas even if the absolute value might be off a bit.
 
 If we really really need to, we could also remove SMR. RMS only needs to call sqrt on a reporting event (much less often) and not when a sample is added.",0

 Right now, if a user does rescue on an instance booted from volume, it looks to me like the following will happen:
 
 * root_vhd_path will return a non-existent path
 * self._vmutils.detach_vm_disk will silently do nothing [1]
 * New disk with invalid path with be added [2]
 
 This definitely won't work as the user intends. As it's unsupported at the moment that's fine, but it would be much nicer to the user to tell them that with a clear error message rather than leaving them wondering why their rescued instance doesn't work.
 
 Also, I haven't looked at the interaction with unrescue, but it's critical that the above mess can be unwound with unrescue. If it currently work it's presumably just luck :)
 
 TL;DR
 
 Not supporting everything is fine, but I think you need to explicitly check that root_vhd_path exists and there is only 1 disk. If not, you need to error out early.

 * template author(s) write template(s) and annotate them
 * deployer has template that needs capabilities (provided by other templates)
 * deployer discovers other templates that have the capability
 * deployer selects provider templates and writes corresponding env file
 * deployed deploys top level template with the env file

(2) If they do not, then force enrollment/sync until they contain the same supported features.

In this scheme, we wouldn't need to worry about the ListValues at all, since we wouldn't be storing any values in preferences.

 Previously, you used to ask me to split this patch into 2 separate patches (for easier review). The current one is for fixing the az info issue and the second one (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/149952/) is for fixing the ""if not host"" issue. 
 
 The modification of the guy ""Hans ..."" is exactly the same as my second patch which is for fixing only the issue ""if not host"".
 
 So, if I rebase as your wish then your previous suggestion of splitting (for easier review) will become silly and bullshit, right???
 
 You are not consistent in making review at all????

 2. I see, I'll add more comment on top of it.
 
 The basic idea is that we should not ping DUT too often.
 I think at least >= 5 mins (maybe we can choose 10 mins or 15 mins).
 We wanted to test the capability of DUT to maintain an idle connection with AP (this involves time synchronization, wake up from power-saving mode).
 
 DUT should remain the connection during the test.

The problem is that it's dumb for all the server implementation code to have to check for whether or not a header value is a list, and it's also dumb to make single-value headers lists just for the sake of consistency.

"i misunderstood what you were asking. (there are too damn many different kinds of macros, all with very similar names!)

i thought you were asking about macros like _POSIX_ADVISORY_INFO which must always be defined, but whose value tells you whether their feature is supported. obviously these ones need to be defined.

but now i guess you were actually talking about ones like _POSIX_SS_REPL_MAX which should _not_ be defined if you don't have the optional feature it belongs to. obviously these ones need to _not_ be defined.

as for _POSIX2_FORT_DEV, note the ""if"" in what POSIX actually says: ""If this symbol is defined in <unistd.h>, it shall be defined to be -1, 0, or 200809L."". the little ""[FD]"" next to the name means that this is part of the optional extra FD (Fortran Development). we don't have that, so we don't need to have any of the defines, and it's probably less confusing to just remove them. (though, as you say, in this case at least they let us set it to -1.)

"(It took me a month to understand what this code was supposed to do, so who is being stupid here?:).
First, I find out if the destination is 1 cell or a range, and if the source area is large than the selected destination area [1271-1279]. The largest area of these is taken for the comparisons [1282-1283], as this will be the actual destination area (copy/paste some blocks and you will see what I mean if my text is not clear).
The first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap [1284-1288]. When the source area contains references, these probably will go wrong when there is an overlap. As this may produce data loss (e.g. formulas that get wrong references), it _must_ be avoided. This code was there from the beginning, but with errors, disabling the wrong options. My first patch fixed only a part of that.
The second comparison [1294-1327] handles something else, the question whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit on the sheet. This comparison is not necessary for integrity, but for user friendliness. Without the comparison, the user will get a message that the result will not fit and no harm is done. Rainer Bielefeld wanted the possibilty of fitting on the sheet reflected in the en/disabling of the shift options.
I do this check by going from the MAXCOL/MAXROW position back for the width/height of the destination area and checking if the cells are empty. If not, paste+shift will not fit and the appropiate shit option is disabled.
I feared a performance penalty with this method, but I tested it on an old. slow machine (complete build of Libreofiice takes 24hrs) with a destination area almost MAXROW high and that gave no noticeable delay.
But because of this performance penalty danger, i want you to have a good look at the code. Perhaps it will be safer to leave it out, perhaps there are more efficient ways to check the fitting.

I hope my proze give you the explanation you want.
Perhaps I should put some of it in the code as comment?",1

"Chris: I'm sort of of the mind that having only two tests here to begin with speaks to insufficient coverage of the capability and paints us into a corner with respect to procedure (e.g. what if Tempest just flat out had a bug that broke these two tests?). This is something we should bring up with the Committee. In the interim I'd like to look and see if there aren't other tests that could be added for the capability, but unfortunately they'd have to go through the advisory cycle first and won't really help for 2015.05(ish). I'll also note that there's a *potential* loophole should we feel the need to invoke it: the bylaw states that *vendors* may not request flagging all tests for a capability (refer to https://github.com/openstack/defcore/blob/master/process/2015A.rst#community-review--vendor-self-test-c C(3)4 for the actual wording). So if, for example, the Foundation (through it's Interoperability Engineer, presumably) or perhaps folks acting on behalf of the Board (like, say, the co-chairs of the DefCore Committee, though I'll note one of them has a potential conflict of interest in this particular instance as she is employed by the same vendor) were to request it, that wouldn't violate the bylaw.
 
 In the interim: you're right. We can't accept dropping all the tests for a capability at a vendor's request, so I'm -1. Still, I'm going to look into whether there are additional tests we should be including so that they can start the advisory phase sooner rather than later.",0

I wanted to keep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem URLs, so I tried to use WaitForLoadStop(), which just exits immediately if a navigation hasn't started yet.  However, with blob: URLs, that still didn't work, because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side, so the ExecuteScript that sets location above returns before we've received the BeginNavigation from the renderer.  Hence this ugly extra dummy ExecuteScript.  Without it, we performed the checks below too early, and when GetTextContent() below did a roundtrip to the renderer, we actually received the BeginNavigation and created a speculative RFH, which caused GetRenderFrameHostsForExtension to fail.

Alternatively, I could wait for filesystem URLs to fail with a console error, similar to what Mustafa did on line 1118.

"> kill -0 basically validates the pid
That's a smart way to validate a pid.
I will update Makefile with kill in a separate CL.

> There's another case here though where the master could be dead but the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master... maybe check the command line as well or cwd of the pid?  fds etc?

I believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd.

For example, if ""make status"" returns 0 for a process running, but unhealthy, then puppet or most of system management tool would believe that it is not running, and the following /etc/init.d/buildbot start would fail at the following check

: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build.git/+/master/slave/run_slave.py#249


We could also update the above python check function, but I believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate process checking for the health of a service: ""the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master""

In other words, /etc/init.d/status should return ""running"" if a process is running for the service either it is healthy or not.

If ""make status"" should not be limited to the usage of /etc/init.d/buildbot, then I'd suggest to have another make target for health checking.

However, once buildbot is migrated to service_manager, this Makefile will no longer be used.",0

either extraxt_cmdline extracts the raw data, or it doesn't. Then it gets passed to extract_tgid which will either extract the raw data or it wont. As you can see this is going to get cumbersome.

"This is the ugliest extension ever made.
 The author of this extension should be hanged over a pool full of hungry crocodiles.
 
 Obviously I am its original author.
 Adding more stuff to this extension will only make the code even more unmainteinable.
 
 Personally I think external_gateway_info is one of those attributes which should be promoted to sub resource. This will simplify authz policy management, and most importantly the user workflow.
 We need to find a way where the main resource and the sub resource can be created/updated/returned in the same API request. However, if necessary, the user should be able to operate directly on the subresource.
 
 This is probably something that can't be addressed for this release cycle. So if there is any urgency around this blueprint we might proceed this way and then rework it in Kilo.
 
 However, if this patch does not make Juno, I would suggest reworking the external_gateway_info attribute (and yes, we should worry also about backward compatibility)",1

"HmmmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦as far as I can see, you never reset requests.request, which, IMO, is a bad thing. A better way to accomplish what you want is by using mock.patch() in a context manager:
 
  mock_request = mock.Mock()
  mock_request.return_value = requests.Response()
  mock_request.return_value.status_code = 200
  mock_request.return_value.headers = {
  'x-server-management-url': 'blah.com',
  'x-auth-token': 'blah',
  }

  mock_request.assert_called_once_with(mock.ANY, mock.ANY,
  timeout=2,
  headers=mock.ANY,
  verify=mock.ANY,
  config=mock.ANY)
 
 This will isolate the patch on requests.request to just the call to instance.authenticate(). I will also frequently use the decorator form of mock.patch() in this instance, e.g., something like:
 
  @mock.patch('requests.request', return_value=requests.Response())
  def test_client_with_timeout(self, mock_request):
  Ã¢â‚¬Â¦
  mock_request.return_value.status_code = 200

This means that, for those methods, this could result in a notify still containing the context, but missing the first argument to the method, which may be rather useful.
 
 Also, it's worth pointing out that there are no other consumers of get_context_from_function_and_args().

"I don't like this.  You're partially parametrizing the test along a different dimension/variable, in a nested for loop.

I see two options: write out every single case as a separate dumb test, or parametrize properly.  I suggested parametrization due to the shape of the problem; you're just testing cases in the cartesian product of various sets of dimensions

{web, logdir, build, ...} x {short, long} x {True, False}
{web, logdir, build, ...} x {short, long} x {servo, firmware, ...}

This is the worst of both worlds: You're copy-pasting the test across {web, logdir, build, ...}, and parametrizing across {short, long} x {server, firmware, ...}  You are paying the complexity price for the parametrization while still keeping some duplication that the parametrization is supposed to remove.",0

 Once we update the resource with a router or router + list of ports - these columns will be populated.
 
 So in that sense it is not required but that only implies logical resource creation.

  if not cache_override:

It's subtle, but that block of code will incorrectly fallback to the internal cache if the passed in cache_override is {} (which may be entirely intentional- to force a run w/out using internal caches values).

 2) I didn't look at the body of MergeWithOtherSnapshotImpl() which is a friend and it uses process_reader_, and needs the real type, and;
 3) Fuchsia didn't actually have a Memory() method anyway (though that one is addable).
 
 I could probably share Fuchsia's with Linux's, but it'd still need to be a template then to handle ProcessReader, so it seemed less worthwhile since shoving it all in the header sort of sucks. (I also couldn't think of a name for the template... MemorySnapshotLinuxAndroidFuchsia isn't exactly pretty.)

I agree with you on both counts, but at the same time, that's not a battle I'd like to fight with upstream as part of *this* commit.  A mass cleanup of the error handling to use err or similar would be nice, but not in this commit.

As for the uniqueness of the error message, between the error message and the filename, the message should be identifiable, and in any case the error will be identifiable.  In addition, an error other than ENOENT here seems highly unlikely.

 Similarly, if a query is done for `instance` it is unlikely, but not impossible, that some data after the upgrade will come from notifications and some from polling.
 
 Therefore I need the answer to two questions:
 
 * How can I form a query that says ""only give me polling data for meter X""?
 * How can I form a query that says ""only give me results after the upgrade""?

 If you say that (the same) tag can be associated to multiple resources, and that (the same) resource is associated to multiple tags, this is not the right way to model this logically, otherwise you'll end up having lots of duplicated and a non-normalized schema.
 
 Say for instance that I want to tag my networks with 'golden'. I'd need to have lots of entries like so:
 
  1, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_1
  2, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_2
  3, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_3
  4, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_4
 
 This is a waste from a number of perspectives: from storage, lookup and cascading effects.
 
 Instead you should have, a tag table
 
  tag, description, where tag is key
 
 and a mapping table
 
  tag_id, resource_type, resource_id
 
 This still sucks though, because now you cannot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id; i.e. if a resource gets deleted now you gotta enforce the delete on cascade via programming logic, which is yucky.
 
 Ultimately we'd need to have a mapping table for resource. I know, it's more work, but that gives you the most leverage of the DBMS capabilies",1

But both of the above seem to imply that they only control inclusion/exclusion of debug data.  I think it would be conceivable that the flag could have deeper effects.  Say, do not deduplicate methods to make sure they can be identified, or omit some optimizations that rearrange code.

Anyway, this is just bike-shedding about names.  I would not want to change it as part of this CL.  I picked GDBInformation here somewhat randomly, and made sure it is at least consistent with Quick and Elf Writer.

 If you always throw ShareResourceNotFound (no if/else condition as in your code), manager will do exactly what you are doing, it will swallow the exception and proceed. If it is not ""Deleting path"", as you are checking for such in share status, it will throw exception, just as are you doing, since manager is only swallowing the exception when deleting the share.
 
 The only scenario which I think this is valid is if this library is used outside of Manila, which is what I understood based on our IRC conversation, but by using share['status'] here I am assuming it will not be used outside of Manila Manager code path.

 Similarly, if a query is done for `instance` it is unlikely, but not impossible, that some data after the upgrade will come from notifications and some from polling.
 
 Therefore I need the answer to two questions:
 
 * How can I form a query that says ""only give me polling data for meter X""?
 * How can I form a query that says ""only give me results after the upgrade""?

The worst part about it is that the actual config loading API (cfgclient.Get) doesn't use ${appid}. Users will have to be careful to construct exact same strings as they use in validation patterns.

Do you have any suggestions?

I'm considering moving this placeholders shit up a layer into the root of the config library, so that both cfgclient and validation rules can use it (e.g. we'll be able to do cfgclient.Get(..., ""services/${appid}"", ...)). But it adds a weird-ass concept to already incredibly complicated API.

On the other hand a user may forget to supply or decide not to supply volume_id and in this case all hosts should pass. In this case I set filtering_result to True and use it as return value. If on the yet another hand it is set to None that means that we have a valid volume_id and are in process of filtering.

 That's a smart way to validate a pid.
 I will update Makefile with kill in a separate CL.
 
 > There's another case here though where the master could be dead but the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master... maybe check the command line as well or cwd of the pid? fds etc?
 
 I believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd.
 
 For example, if ""make status"" returns 0 for a process running, but unhealthy, then puppet or most of system management tool would believe that it is not running, and the following /etc/init.d/buildbot start would fail at the following check
 
 : https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build.git/+/master/slave/run_slave.py#249
 
 
 We could also update the above python check function, but I believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate process checking for the health of a service: ""the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master""
 
 In other words, /etc/init.d/status should return ""running"" if a process is running for the service either it is healthy or not.
 
 If ""make status"" should not be limited to the usage of /etc/init.d/buildbot, then I'd suggest to have another make target for health checking.

this is extract from: http://omappedia.org/wiki/HWMOD

there is a opt_clk field en the hwmod structures but they are not enable when you enable the device:
static int _enable_clocks(struct omap_hwmod *oh)

...
     /* The opt clocks are controlled by the device driver. */

"I definitely agree we shouldn't mix the two. I think the list syntax makes more sense in this case than it does in capabilities (I previously made comments to this end on that spec, but they got lost in a previous patchset, so I'll review it again soon).
 
 Take a simple resource registry:
 
 resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::BlockStorage: cinder-storage.yaml
  OS::TripleO::Compute: compute.yaml
 
 What that is saying is that when a template creates a resource of type BlockStorage, it should use the cinder-storage.yaml file.
 
 Taking the example from the capabilities:
 
 requires:
  deployment: puppet
 
 resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::Controller: [puppet/controller.yaml, docker/controller.yaml]
 
 You (as the template reader/maintainer, not as Heat programmatically reading it) are no longer able to see what template will be used. That information has moved to the ""requires"" area plus some additional logic that looks inside the templates themselves.
 
 Now factor in the alternative in this spec for using a parameter driven approach.
 That's now a third place you need to look to understand which template(s) will be used to fulfill a given type, leaving us with the following to understand a set of templates:
 
 1. Look in the resource registry to see the mapping for a type.
 2. If the mapping is a list, look at the requires and the contents of each template referenced to see which one will fulfill the requires.
 3. Look through the top level template itself for any ResourceChain resources, determine the name of the parameter that's used to convey the list of templates in the chain, then resolve what the current value of that parameter is.
 
 IMO, this is a rough experience for the user. We've taken the knowledge of how a stack will be created and spread it over the course of multiple areas and files.
 
 By comparison, my argument is that:
 
 - Capabilities aren't a black box resolution by Heat, but rather just metadata the user can ask Heat to introspect to determine valid mappings to make in the resource_registry. 
 - Chains are communicated inside of the registry itself.
 
 That flow leaves the mappings in a single place: the resource registry. It's simpler both for user comprehension and clients that may be layering on top of the templates.",0

"Well the logic of claiming/consuming instances is not what caused this bug (and it is well tested). What caused it is moving to and from objects in the resource tracker, and then dropping an important field due to that.
 
 So in the resource tracker we have pci pool dicts (would contain numa_node as a key), but then we convert them to objects [1] by using PciDevicePool.from_dict, which would drop the field and save it as part of tags.
 
 Upon reading them in on the scheduler side, we call PciDevicePool.to_dict, which of course will not know about the 'numa_node' since it's not on the object. For filtering to work numa_node needs to match (and it's actually gone) so all requests fail.
 
 The code in [1] merged 2 months after the patch that introduces NUMA awareness of PCI devices.
 
 TL; DR - this got borken by our neverending objects fuckery - it was not broken by definition as you seem to imply with your comments here.
 
 The commit message is misleading though so I will update it now.

"I have a couple of concerns here. The most minor one is that this now forces us to use this decorator only on instance or class methods; is there anywhere where this is not the case?
 
 The second concern is that, if I recall correctly, the get_context_from_function_and_args() function was created because the decorator was used on some methods where context had to be searched for, which argues that, for those methods, it is not the first non-self argument to the method. This means that, for those methods, this could result in a notify still containing the context, but missing the first argument to the method, which may be rather useful.
 
 Also, it's worth pointing out that there are no other consumers of get_context_from_function_and_args(). (It is used in nova/openstack/common/notifier/api.py, but the version used is of course from nova/openstack/common/context.py.)

 I agree that these names suck.

 I tried a few things but I'll keep it as-is if you don't object.
 
 Conceptually I want a ""Future<Boolean> testLoaderResult"" object for which I can set the boolean value without unblocking the test thread (in requestSeedFromService()), and then unblock it later (in onBackgroundWorkFinished()).
 
 Basing such on object on CallbackHelper might not be any better than what I have now; I can't explicitly protect the derived class' boolean with CallbackHelper's internal lock, so the boolean field would need to be handled just as carefully as MutableBoolean currently is.
 
 Basing the object on FutureTask is confusing because the Runnable/Callable has nothing to do.

 Which would work ... but the code to implement the graceful shutdown could be pretty easy (potentially just a few lines of code), so might be worth thinking about.
 
 It's probably just a matter of changing these functions in wsgi.py:
 
 
  def wait_on_children(self):
  while self.running:
  try:
  pid, status = os.wait()
  if os.WIFEXITED(status) or os.WIFSIGNALED(status):
  self._remove_children(pid)
  self._verify_and_respawn_children(pid, status)
  except OSError as err:
  if err.errno not in (errno.EINTR, errno.ECHILD):
  raise
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
  LOG.info(_LI('Caught keyboard interrupt. Exiting.'))
  break
  except exception.SIGHUPInterrupt:
  self.reload()
  continue
  eventlet.greenio.shutdown_safe(self.sock)
  self.sock.close()
  LOG.debug('Exited')
 
 
  def run_child(self):
  def child_hup(*args):
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled.""""""
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal.SIG_IGN)
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False
  self.sock.close()
 
  pid = os.fork()
  if pid == 0:
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, child_hup)
  signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
 
 to look like this:
 
  def wait_on_children(self):
  while self.running:
  try:
  pid, status = os.wait()
  if os.WIFEXITED(status) or os.WIFSIGNALED(status):
  self._remove_children(pid)
  self._verify_and_respawn_children(pid, status)
  except OSError as err:
  if err.errno not in (errno.EINTR, errno.ECHILD):
  raise
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
  LOG.info(_LI('Caught keyboard interrupt. Exiting.'))
  break
  except exception.SIGHUPInterrupt:
  self.reload()
  continue
  except exception.SIGSTOPInterrupt: <<<
  self.graceful_shutdown() <<<
  continue <<<
  eventlet.greenio.shutdown_safe(self.sock)
  self.sock.close()
  LOG.debug('Exited')
 
 
  def run_child(self):
  def child_hup(*args):
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled.""""""
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal.SIG_IGN)
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False
  self.sock.close()
 
  def child_stop(*args): <<<
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled."""""" <<<
  signal.signal(signal.SIGSTOP, signal.SIG_IGN) <<< 
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False <<< 
  self.sock.close() <<<
 
  pid = os.fork()
  if pid == 0:
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, child_hup)
  signal.signal(signal.SIGSTOP, child_stop) <<<
  signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
 
 
 And add this one line function:
 
  def graceful_shutdown(self):
  """"""
  Send signal to child processes to handle current requests then exit
  """"""
  os.killpg(self.pgid, signal.SIGSTOP)
 
 
 I haven't tested the above, I think it might be sufficient because the existing code will do the accounting of the number of children and exit when self.children hits zero, but it'd need testing.

"Dear Duncan Thomas,
 
 This is not a version comparision here rather a referential comparision only, so doing string comparision will not be a problem.
 Actually, version comparision is done earlier and here we are just comparing whether it is None or else ""3.2""..
 
 Let me explain:
 
 Actual https header version comparision is done at
 https://review.openstack.org/#/c/278605/35/cinder/api/v2/volumes.py 
 we pass string ""3.2"" to differentiate the function call is for microversion:
  
 if req.api_version_request.matches(""3.2"", None):
  self.volume_api.check_volume_filters(filters, *""3.2""*)
 else:
  self.volume_api.check_volume_filters(filters)
 
 Then here we compare this argument part(""3.2"") as string comparision here to check if this call needs to be executed as per microversion or normal.

 If you say that (the same) tag can be associated to multiple resources, and that (the same) resource is associated to multiple tags, this is not the right way to model this logically, otherwise you'll end up having lots of duplicated and a non-normalized schema.
 
 Say for instance that I want to tag my networks with 'golden'. I'd need to have lots of entries like so:
 
  1, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_1
  2, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_2
  3, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_3
  4, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_4
 
 This is a waste from a number of perspectives: from storage, lookup and cascading effects.
 
 Instead you should have, a tag table
 
  tag, description, where tag is key
 
 and a mapping table
 
  tag_id, resource_type, resource_id
 
 This still sucks though, because now you cannot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id; i.e. if a resource gets deleted now you gotta enforce the delete on cascade via programming logic, which is yucky.
 
 Ultimately we'd need to have a mapping table for resource. I know, it's more work, but that gives you the most leverage of the DBMS capabilies",1

"funny definition of ""shorter"". 
Getting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print ""bah, your installed version sucks"", but also being able to print ""we detected that you have version xy installed, but we need at least version wz""

Also your proposal fails short since not all versions of flex report the version as second field. Especially those that are not suitable to build (like 2.5.4 for example) print ""flex version <whatever version>"":
$ /usr/bin/flex -V | cut -d"" "" -f2 | sed 's/\.//'g
version

Also while your suggestion works for something like flex (where not much releases are expected), it doesn't account for increase/decrease of the digits in the minor/micro version part

while 2.5.36 will fulfill the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535, a hypothetical version 2.6.1 will be treated as 261 and thus fail the check.

If you only want one single command, and disregard storing the version for printing in the error in case of failure to pass, then one could use 

flex --version |awk '{split($NF,ver,"".""); printf(""%d%03d%03d"", ver[1], ver[2], ver[3])}'

of to be ""shorter"" :-) : flex -V | awk ....

I agree with the the aesthetic appeal of keeping fields and their types together. Other than that, I'm not convinced. I don't see why you need to inspect this object at all. I don't see the advantage of this over something as dumb as:

  class NtbParameters(object):
      def __init__(self, w_length, bm_ntb_formats_supported, ...):
          self.w_length = w_length
          self.bm_ntb_formats_supported = bm_ntb_formats_supported
          ...

      @classmethod
      def get_format_string(cls):
          return 'HHIHHHHIHHHH'

"The 'else' branch here is usually where we execute native plexxi actions, i.e. actions that are implemented in the plexxi libraries. But the way the rest of the driver is written, that's hard to do right. They import 10 different classes (AffinityGroup, Job, PhysicalPort, PlexxiSwitch), each of which has actions that could be executed. So the 'else' branch here isn't going to work.
 
 I'd probably get the bug fixed first and then think about whether it's worth exposing all the native plexxi actions. So you could get away without the 'else' branch here and leave a TODO saying something like what I explained above.",0
